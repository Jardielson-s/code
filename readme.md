# Description

<p>
all the code was done using pure functions, ie for the same inputs without going to produce the same outputs, without side effect. 

The findBestDeliveries function checks if a drone x has enough weight capacity to drop off products at location x.

The readInputFile function converts inputs into a certain pattern.

# Run
